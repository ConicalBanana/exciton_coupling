Example files to use the DIA method for the coupling. The DIA method can be used with one of two properties:

1) TDM (Recommended)
2) ATC

When TDM is used, three calculations are needed - the first two excited states of the supermolecular dimer, and
the first excited state of each of constituent monomers, using 'nosymm' throughout. With the ATC property, a further
two calculations are required, to calculate the transition charges of the s1 and s2 states of the supermolecule. These 
are inexpensive if the densities are read from the checkpoint file. Furthermore, with the ATC method, the atomic ordering
is vitally important. In one monomer, the atomic ordering must correspond to the atomic ordering in the other monomer, and 
should also be consisent with the dimer. 

TDM Usage:

exciton_coupling.py -m DIA -p TDM -df dimer.log -mf mon_0.log mon_1.log -u ev

ATC Usage:

exciton_coupling.py -m DIA -p TDM -df dimer.log dimer_s1.log dimer_s2.log -mf mon_0.log mon_1.log -u ev
