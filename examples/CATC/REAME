Example files to calculate the CATC exciton coupling. No supermolecular (whole dimer) calculation is required.
 Each log file contains the output from a G09 calculation,
where each calculation contains one monomer of the consituent dimer. The orientation should be kept constant, to
ensure the dimer geometry, by using "nosymm" in the gaussian input card. 

Usage:

exciton_coupling.py -m CATC -u ev -mf mon_0.log mon_1.log
